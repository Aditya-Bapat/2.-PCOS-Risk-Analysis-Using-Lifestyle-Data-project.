PCOS Risk Analysis Using Lifestyle Data project.

Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset containing 173 female health records with 36 lifestyle and medil features.
Cleaned and standardized categorical values (e.g., "Yes"/"No", "Diagnosed by doctor") for better analytical consistency.
Created interactive visualizations using Plotly to explore patterns between PCOS and factors such as: Hormonal Imbalance, Insulin Resistance, Stress Level, Exercise Frequency
Identified the top 5 lifestyle/medical indicators most strongly correlated with PCOS using correlation heatmaps and bar plots.
Found that hormonal imbalance showed a strong correlation (~0.65+) with PCOS, supporting clinical insights.
Simplified interpretation of health features by removing ambiguous labels and using clean binary encoding (0 = No, 1 = Yes).
Built clear and concise risk interpretation dashboards for improved readability and communication.
